### 1\. **What is Maven?**

Maven is a **build automation and dependency management tool** for Java-based projects. It simplifies the process of building, reporting, and documenting via a Project Object Model (POM).

---

### 2\. **What are the advantages of using Maven?**

* **Dependency Management**: Automatically downloads and resolves dependencies.
    
* **Consistent Builds**: Ensures builds are reproducible.
    
* **Convention over Configuration**: Reduces configuration effort.
    
* **Multi-module project support**.
    
* **Integration** with CI/CD tools.
    

---

### 3\. **What is a POM file? What does it contain?**

POM (Project Object Model) is an XML file (`pom.xml`) that describes the project and configuration details like:

* Project coordinates (groupId, artifactId, version)
    
* Dependencies
    
* Build plugins
    
* Profiles
    
* Repositories
    
* Properties
    

---

### 4\. **What is the default location of the local repository in Maven?**

`~/.m2/repository`  
This is the local cache where Maven stores downloaded artifacts.

---

### 5\. **What is the difference between** `install`, `package`, and `deploy` goals in Maven?

* `package`: Compiles code and packages it into a `.jar` or `.war`.
    
* `install`: Installs the package into the local repository.
    
* `deploy`: Uploads the built artifact to a remote repository (used in release processes).
    

---

### 6\. **How do you add a dependency in Maven?**

Add the dependency block to `pom.xml`:

```plaintext
xmlCopyEdit<dependency>
  <groupId>org.springframework</groupId>
  <artifactId>spring-core</artifactId>
  <version>6.0.0</version>
</dependency>
```

---

### 7\. **What is the role of** `settings.xml` in Maven?

`settings.xml` (located in `~/.m2/`) contains:

* Proxy settings
    
* Repository credentials
    
* Mirrors
    
* Profiles specific to the user or environment
    

---

### 8\. **What are transitive dependencies?**

Dependencies that are **not directly declared** but are included because they are required by other dependencies. Maven resolves them automatically.

---

### 9\. **What is the Maven lifecycle?**

Three built-in lifecycles:

1. **Clean** ‚Äì cleans the project (`clean`)
    
2. **Default** ‚Äì builds the project (`compile`, `test`, `package`, etc.)
    
3. **Site** ‚Äì generates documentation (`site`)
    

Each lifecycle consists of phases and goals.

---

### 10\. **How do you build a Maven project from the command line?**

```plaintext
bashCopyEditmvn clean install
```

This cleans previous builds and installs the new build to the local repository.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è **Intermediate Maven Interview Questions and Answers**

### 11\. **How does Maven resolve dependencies?**

Maven checks:

1. **Local Repository** (`~/.m2/repository`)
    
2. **Remote Repositories** (like Maven Central or custom)
    
3. **Transitive Dependencies**
    

It uses the nearest-wins strategy in case of conflicts.

---

### 12\. **What is the difference between compile, provided, runtime, test, and system scope?**

* `compile` (default): Needed for compile and runtime.
    
* `provided`: Needed to compile, but expected to be provided at runtime (e.g., Servlet API).
    
* `runtime`: Not needed at compile, but needed at runtime.
    
* `test`: Used only during testing.
    
* `system`: Similar to `provided`, but requires an explicit path.
    

---

### 13\. **How do you create a custom Maven plugin?**

1. Create a Java project with `maven-plugin` packaging.
    
2. Annotate plugin classes with `@Mojo`.
    
3. Define goals using `@Parameter`.
    
4. Register in the POM's `build/plugins` section.
    

---

### 14\. **How do profiles work in Maven?**

Profiles allow conditional builds based on:

* OS
    
* Environment
    
* Properties
    
* Active profile (via `-P` flag)
    

They are defined in `pom.xml` or `settings.xml`.

---

### 15\. **What is the use of the** `dependencyManagement` tag?

Used in a **parent POM** to define versions of dependencies so that **child projects can use them** without repeating the version tag.

---

### 16\. **How do you override a dependency version in Maven?**

* Use `dependencyManagement` in a parent POM.
    
* Or redefine the dependency in the child with the desired version.
    

---

### 17\. **What is the effective-pom? How can you see it?**

The **effective POM** is the final configuration that Maven uses after combining all inherited POMs and settings.  
To view:

```plaintext
bashCopyEditmvn help:effective-pom
```

---

### 18\. **How do you skip tests in a Maven build?**

```plaintext
bashCopyEditmvn install -DskipTests
```

This compiles the test code but does not run it.  
Use `-Dmaven.test.skip=true` to skip compilation as well.

---

### 19\. **What is the difference between SNAPSHOT and RELEASE versions?**

* `SNAPSHOT`: Mutable, can be updated with newer builds (for development).
    
* `RELEASE`: Immutable, stable release versions.
    

---

### 20\. **What is a parent POM? How does inheritance work in Maven?**

A parent POM provides **shared configurations and dependencies** to child modules via inheritance. Common settings go in the parent, and the child references it using:

```plaintext
xmlCopyEdit<parent>
  <groupId>com.example</groupId>
  <artifactId>parent-project</artifactId>
  <version>1.0.0</version>
</parent>
```

---

## üîç **Advanced Maven Interview Questions and Answers**

### 21\. **How do you troubleshoot dependency conflicts in Maven?**

Use:

```plaintext
bashCopyEditmvn dependency:tree
```

This shows all dependencies and where conflicts occur. Use `exclusions` to resolve.

---

### 22\. **What is the difference between** `pluginManagement` and `plugins` in a POM?

* `pluginManagement`: Specifies plugin versions and configuration for **child projects**, but does not activate them.
    
* `plugins`: **Activates** the plugin and includes it in the build.
    

---

### 23\. **What are some common issues with multi-module Maven projects?**

* Incorrect parent references
    
* Dependency resolution across modules
    
* Build order issues
    
* Inconsistent plugin versions
    

---

### 24\. **How can Maven be integrated with CI/CD pipelines?**

* Use Maven in tools like **Jenkins, GitLab CI, GitHub Actions**.
    
* Typical pipeline: `mvn clean install` ‚Üí run tests ‚Üí deploy artifacts
    

---

### 25\. **What is the role of the** `assembly` plugin in Maven?

The Assembly Plugin is used to **create distributable packages** (ZIPs, TARs) including dependencies, configuration, and executables.

---

### 26\. **How do you configure Maven to use a proxy or mirror for downloading dependencies?**

Edit `~/.m2/settings.xml`:

```plaintext
xmlCopyEdit<proxies>
  <proxy>
    <id>example-proxy</id>
    <active>true</active>
    <protocol>http</protocol>
    <host>proxy.example.com</host>
    <port>8080</port>
  </proxy>
</proxies>
```

---

### 27\. **Explain how Maven Central works.**

Maven Central is the **default remote repository** for Maven. When a dependency is not found locally, Maven tries to fetch it from Central.

---

### 28\. **What is the difference between** `mvn clean install` and `mvn install clean`?

* `mvn clean install`: Executes the **clean phase first**, then builds and installs.
    
* `mvn install clean`: Executes **install phase** first, then tries to clean, which is illogical. Order matters.
    

---

### 29\. **How do you enforce code quality or formatting standards in a Maven build?**

Use plugins:

* `maven-checkstyle-plugin`
    
* `maven-pmd-plugin`
    
* `spotbugs-maven-plugin`
    
* `formatter-maven-plugin`
    

They can be bound to lifecycle phases or run manually.

---

### 30\. **What strategies do you use to optimize large Maven projects?**

* Use **parallel builds**: `mvn -T 4 clean install`
    
* Use **dependencyManagement** to avoid redundancy
    
* Modularize the project properly
    
* Avoid `SNAPSHOT` in production builds
    
* Use `mvn dependency:analyze` to remove unused deps
