Git is a distributed version control system that helps you track changes in your code and collaborate with others. Think of a shared Microsoft Word file you might use to collaborate on a document.

## This Is How Git Works

#### Here's a simple overview of how Git works in basic steps:  

1. **Initialize a Git Repository**: Start using Git by initializing a repository in your project folder.
    
2. **Add Files**: Tell Git which files you want to track.
    
3. **Commit Changes**: Create a snapshot of the changes by committing them to the repository.
    
4. **Check Status**: See the status of your repository to know which files are modified or staged.
    
5. **Create Branches**: Work on different branches to isolate changes.
    
6. **Switch Branches**: Move between branches.
    
7. **Merge Changes**: Combine changes from one branch into another.
    
8. **Pull and Push**: Fetch and merge changes from a remote repository. Push your changes to the remote repository.
    
9. **Clone a Repository**: Start working on an existing Git repository by cloning it.
    
10. **View History**: Examine the commit history to see who made changes and what changes were made.
