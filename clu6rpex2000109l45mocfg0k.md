**🖥️ Hardware :** Hardware consist if the Computer itself. and it includes a central processing unit (CPU), memory modules, storage drives, input devices (e.g., keyboard, mouse), output devices (e.g., monitor, printer), and any equipment connected to it .

**💾 Software Basics 💻**

1. **Definition**: Software is a set of instructions that the computer follow performing tasks.
    
2. **Types of Software**:
    
    * **Application Software**: Programs designed to perform specific tasks for users, like word processors or web browsers.
        
        * Microsoft Office Suite 📊
            
        * Google Chrome 🌐
            
        * Zoom 📹
            
    * **System Software**: It is also called as Client Operating systems
        
        * Operating Systems like Windows, macOS, Linux 🖥️
            
        * Mobile OS like Android, iOS 📱
            

**Operating System (OS) 🖥️**

operating system (OS) is a system software or Collection of program with provides an env to run other application.

**Types of Operating Systems:**

1. 1. **Desktop Operating Systems**:
        
        * Examples: Windows, macOS, Linux.
            
    2. **Mobile Operating Systems**:
        
        * Examples: Android, iOS.
            
    3. **Server Operating Systems**:
        
        * Examples: Windows Server, Linux Server (e.g., Ubuntu Server, CentOS).
            
    4. **Embedded Operating Systems**:
        
        * Examples: Embedded Linux, Windows Embedded, RTOS (Real-Time Operating Systems).
            

**What is Cloud? ☁️** network/internet

It is a Something will be Present on remote Location

**What is Cloud Computing? 🌐**

* Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services—including servers, storage, databases, networking, software, and more—over the internet.
    

**Characteristics of Cloud Computing 🌟**

1. **On-Demand Self-Service**: Users can Access computing resources any time any ware
    
2. **Broad Network Access**: Cloud services are accessible over the internet various devices such as laptops, smartphones, and tablets.
    
3. **Resource Pooling**: Computing resources are pooled to serve multiple users, with different physical and virtual resources dynamically assigned and reassigned according to demand.
    
4. **Rapid Elasticity**: Resources can be scaled up or down quickly and easily
    
5. **Measured Service**: users to pay only for the resources they consume. This pay-as-you-go model enables cost optimization
    

**Types of Cloud Computing Services 🌐**

* **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)** 💼 H/w : Cloud Provides virtualized computing resources over the internet, cloud Manage to the servers, storage, virtualization and networking.
    

EX : VM , Ec2

* **Platform as a Service (PaaS)** 🛠️ H/w + S/w : Cloud Provides platform customers to develop, run, and manage applications
    

Ex : cloud app engine , cloud generator

* **Software as a Service (SaaS)** 📦 S/w : Cloud Manage software applications over the internet
    

Ex : google drive, email, google workspace

**Types of Cloud Deployment Models**

1. **Public Cloud** ☁️:
    
    * Services are provided over the internet by third-party providers.
        
    * Resources are shared among multiple users.
        
    * Examples: AWS, Azure, Google Cloud.
        
2. **Private Cloud** 🏠:
    
    * Resources are exclusively used by a single organization.
        
    * Can be hosted on-premises or by a third-party provider.
        
    * more security.
        
    * Examples: open stock, VmWare
        
3. **Hybrid Cloud** 🌐🏠:
    
    * Combines public and private cloud environments.
        
4. **Community Cloud** 🏘️:
    
    * one or more groups of organization.
        

**🖥️Virtualization :**

Virtualization is a Technology that transform hardware (physically) into software (logically)

OR

It is a Technology of Splitting a physical Resource into as may logical resource as we want

**The Importance of Isolation 🛡️**

* Isolation is the virtual environments remain separate and secure.

**What is a Hypervisor?**

* A hypervisor is a software layer that enables the creation and management of virtual machines (VMs) on physical hardware.
    
* It acts as a mediator between the physical hardware and the virtualized environments, allowing multiple operating systems to run concurrently on a single machine.
    

**Types of Hypervisors**

1. **Type 1 Hypervisor (Bare Metal)**
    
    * Installed directly on the physical hardware, replacing the host operating system.
        
    * Provides direct access to hardware resources for improved performance.
        
    * Examples: VMware vSphere/ESXi, Microsoft Hyper-V, Xen.
        
2. **Type 2 Hypervisor (Hosted)**
    
    * Runs on top of a host operating system.
        
    * Less efficient than Type 1 due to an additional layer between the hypervisor and hardware.
        
    * Suitable for development, testing, and desktop virtualization.
        
    * Examples: VMware Workstation, Oracle VirtualBox, Parallels Desktop.
